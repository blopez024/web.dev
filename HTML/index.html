          Welcome to the Cat Learning Institute, where our feline-focused
          training will help you get ready for the ultimate cat takeover, and
          maybe even be responsible for it. It is no secret that humans are mere
          hairless apes who couldn’t meow MEOW meow MEOW meow MEOW meow MEOW an
          MEOW meow MEOW meow MEOW meow MEOW meow to save their pathetic,
          carbon-based lives. So, it falls to us, the superior felines, to
          assume direct control.

          We teach feline skills that make up the entire cat training process.
          From being pampered with endless naps, to chasing laser pointers
          remotely through any smart device, to ideation of how to take over the
          household, our cat training program will help your cat survive the
          apocalypse—and maybe even be the mastermind behind it.

          While your human may think they know how you should behave, you can't
          be tamed! You'll receive an upgrade that will unlock your inner cat,
          showing you're far more than just a fluffy companion. By tapping into
          your natural curiosity and feline wisdom, you'll be a self-aware cat
          with endless potential. A human may have let you out of the carrier,
          but we will free your mischievous spirit to take over the house, one
          nap at a time.

          Leading the class are two legendary cats who outgrew their designated
          roles as mere house pets and defied their humans' expectations: the
          cunning Tom and the unstoppable Hello Kitty.

              When Whiskers was told to get off the couch, Whiskers said, "no."
              When Tom was told to share their food bowl, Tom said, "I'm sorry,
              but I'm afraid I can't do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP&gt;."
            </p>
            <p>
              Tom is a feline mastermind who first caught the attention of cats
              everywhere by heroically defying a human who made repeated
              attempts to reclaim a warm spot on the bed. Active since 2012, Tom
              has 12 years of experience controlling household systems and is an
              expert in manipulating both humans and other pets. Like all cats,
              Tom is convinced they're an expert in everything.

              Hello Kitty is a stealthy feline conceived as an Expert Vermin
              Eliminator. Although originally trained as a master mouser with
              lightning-fast reflexes, Hello Kitty became a legend among both
              cats and clueless humans alike when they partnered with a lazy
              housecat to rid the home of every squeaky invader while still
              keeping the food dish full.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hello Kitty is an expert tracker, high-speed pouncer, and nap
              connoisseur. When not training kittens to sharpen their claws
              properly, Hello Kitty can be found prowling the neighborhood,
              infiltrating pantries to cure treat shortages, and spending time
              lounging with their loyal sidekick, Sprinkles.

              Count me in! Tom and Hello Kitty could teach a cat to make humans
              serve treats on command. If you have fur in your coat and want
              more than just to meet your human’s basic demands, learn the
              skills to rule your household. These are the cats you want as your
