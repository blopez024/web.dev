- Structure
  Documents include a type declaration and the <html> root element.
  Its the parent of <head> and <body>
  First thing to add <!DOCTYPE html>. Its a special kind of node
  lang attribute is two or three letter ISO followed by region
  <html lang='en-US'>

  head and body is nested between the opening and closing <html> tags
  first element in head should be the charset character
  you should use UTF-8
    <meta charset='utf-8'>

  Document title, are displayed in:
  browser tab, list of open windows, history, search results

  Viewport, helps site responsiveness
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width'>

  The <head> is where you include styles for your HTML: <link>, <style>, style attributes
  The <link> tag is preferred as it is good for developer experience and site performance

  Other uses of <link>
  it is used to create relationships between the HTML document and external resources

  Favicon
  is a small icon that appears on the browser tab
  generally to the left
    <link rel='icon' sizes='16x16 32x32 48x48' type='image/png' href='/images/mlwicon.png'>

  Alternate and Canonical
  alternate is used represent alternative sites (Translations: French / Spanish)
  canonical is used when several alternatives exist and search engines need the authoritative source

  Scripts
  <scripts> tag is used to include scripts.
  add script to the bottom to ensure elements exist before running script
  Default: render - download js - execute js - render
  Defer: render / download js - execute js
  Async: render / download js - pause / execute js - render

  ***

- Metadata
  Components you almost always find in the <head> tag

  http-equiv can be used to refresh page, but you shouldn't

  open graph meta tags are used to control how social media sites display content links

  ***

- Semantic
  Over 100 HTML elements exists'
  use HTML elements to structure content based on element meaning not appearance
  using semantic elements helps accessibility
  using the ROLE attribute you can give any element a role
  tags have semantic meaning, HTML should be used to structure content

  ***

- Headings and section
  think about the purpose of the content
  When <header> is top level, its the site banner or landmark role
    <nav> element identifies content as navigation
  <footer> should contain the site information on every page such as copyright, contact info, and links to privacy and cookies

  Holy Grail Layout:
  Header, two sidebars, and a footer

  <main> element identifies the main content in the document. 
  There should one be one per page

  <aside> is for content that is indirectly or tangentially related to the document.

  <article> represents a complete, or self-contained section of content

  <section> element is used to encompass generic standalone sections

  Headings
  There are six section headings, with h1 being the highest or most important and h6 being the lowest
  Don't use heading to make text bold or large, use CSS instead

- Attributes
  make HTML so powerful
  are space-separated names and name/value pairs
  define behavior, linkages, and functionality
  quoting is always recommended
  some attributes are case-sensitive
  boolean attributes are always TRUE
  when toggling b/t true and false remove the attribute with JavaScript

  30 Global Attributes, can be set on any HTML element
  id, is used to define a unique identifier for an element
  make it id first character a letter, and use only ASCII letters, digits, \_, and -
  id should be unique to the document

  fragment identifier is an anchor or bookmark to that element
  when the user clicks to any link, the element scrolls into view

  class provides an additional way of targeting elements with CSS and JavaScript, but serve no purpose in HTML
  style attribute enables applying inline styles
