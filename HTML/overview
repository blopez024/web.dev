- Structure
  Documents include a type declaration and the <html> root element.
  Its the parent of <head> and <body>
  First thing to add <!DOCTYPE html>. Its a special kind of node
  lang attribute is two or three letter ISO followed by region
  <html lang='en-US'>

  head and body is nested between the opening and closing <html> tags
  first element in head should be the charset character
  you should use UTF-8
    <meta charset='utf-8'>

  Document title, are displayed in:
  browser tab, list of open windows, history, search results

  Viewport, helps site responsiveness
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width'>

  The <head> is where you include styles for your HTML: <link>, <style>, style attributes
  The <link> tag is preferred as it is good for developer experience and site performance

  Other uses of <link>
  it is used to create relationships between the HTML document and external resources

  Favicon
  is a small icon that appears on the browser tab
  generally to the left
    <link rel='icon' sizes='16x16 32x32 48x48' type='image/png' href='/images/mlwicon.png'>

  <scripts> tag is used to include scripts.
  add script to the bottom to ensure elements exist before running script
  Default: render - download js - execute js - render
  Defer: render / download js - execute js
